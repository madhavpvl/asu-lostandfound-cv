# LostSunDevils.com – ASU Lost & Found CV Project

A smart lost and found system using computer vision to streamline item recovery at Arizona State University.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Manual lost & found systems at ASU result in poor recovery rates. Our solution uses a web platform and computer vision to automate image tagging and retrieval of lost items.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Model:** MobileNetV2
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Features:** Item classification + color detection (`webcolors`)
- **Prototype UI:** [Figma Mockup](https://LostSunDevils.com)

## 🧰 How It Works
1. 📷 Security uploads item image
2. 🧠 CV model classifies + detects color
3. 🔍 Users search with image/keywords
4. ✅ Match found → claim initiated
